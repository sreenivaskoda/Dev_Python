# Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
'''
Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
	Addition
	Subtraction
	Multiplication
	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
'''

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
add = a + b
sub = a - b
mult = a * b 
Div = a / b 
print("Addition: " , add)
print("Subtraction: ", sub)
print("Multiplication: ", mult)
print("Division: ", Div)
